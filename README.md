# Yelp Dataset Cleaning and exploration.

## Question we are trying to answer
- Is this dataset useable for our project of a tokyo resturant tinder app?
- (If not) Is there an alternative place we can look to make this app for people?
- What data is useful to our project?
- What overall insight can we gleen from looking at the rate data?

## Description

This project aims to process the Yelp Academic Dataset and make it usable for an application. The Yelp Academic Dataset is a large collection of user-generated reviews, business information, and social network data. By processing this dataset, we can extract valuable insights and prepare the data for use in an application.

The dataset can be obtained from the official Yelp website at: [www.yelp.com/dataset](www.yelp.com/dataset)

## Features

- Data extraction: Extract relevant information from the Yelp Academic Dataset.
- Data cleaning: Perform data cleaning operations to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates.
- Data transformation: Transform the dataset into a structured format suitable for application usage.
- Data analysis: Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights and understand patterns within the dataset.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11.4
- Pandas library
- NumPy library
- Matplotlib library (for data visualization, if needed)

## Usage

1. Download the Yelp Academic Dataset from [www.yelp.com/dataset](www.yelp.com/dataset).
2. Place the dataset files in the appropriate directory within the project.
3. Run the Python script `data_processing.py` to process the dataset.
4. The processed data will be saved in a suitable format for further application development.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with a web application or API to provide access to the processed Yelp dataset.
- Implementation of advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques for deeper insights.
